    "Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: \"the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\" This is an older, informal definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: playing checkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    E = the experience of playing many games of checkers\n",
    "\n",
    "    T = the task of playing checkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    P = the probability that the program will win the next game.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.\n",

    "    1.1 Here's a definition of what is machine learning as due to Arthur Samuel. He defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly learned.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.2 Samuel's claim to fame was that back in the 1950, he wrote a checkers playing program and the amazing thing about this checkers playing program was that Arthur Samuel himself wasn't a very good checkers player. But what he did was he had to programmed maybe tens of thousands of games against himself, and by watching what sorts of board positions tended to lead to wins and what sort of board positions tended to lead to losses, the checkers playing program learned over time what are good board positions and what are bad board positions. And eventually learn to play checkers better than the Arthur Samuel himself was able to. This was a remarkable result. Arthur Samuel himself turns out not to be a very good checkers player. But because a computer has the patience to play tens of thousands of games against itself, no human has the patience to play that many games. By doing this, a computer was able to get so much checkers playing experience that it eventually became a better checkers player than Arthur himself.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.3 This is a somewhat informal definition and an older one. Here's a slightly more recent definition by Tom Mitchell who's a friend of Carnegie Melon. So Tom defines machine learning by saying that a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows. He says, a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. I actually think he came out with this definition just to make it rhyme. For the checkers playing examples, the experience E would be the experience of having the program play tens of thousands of games itself. The task T would be the task of playing checkers, and the performance measure P will be the probability that wins the next game of checkers against some new opponent.\n",

    "    \n",
    "        An important precursor to Tesauro's TD-Gammon was the seminal work of Arthur Samuel (1959, 1967) in constructing programs for learning to play checkers. Samuel was one of the first to make effective use of heuristic search methods and of what we would now call temporal-difference learning. His checkers players are instructive case studies in addition to being of historical interest. We emphasize the relationship of Samuel's methods to modern reinforcement learning methods and try to convey some of Samuel's motivation for using them\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.5 Samuel first wrote a checkers-playing program for the IBM 701 in 1952. His first learning program was completed in 1955 and was demonstrated on television in 1956. Later versions of the program achieved good, though not expert, playing skill.\n",

    "In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning problems are categorized into \"regression\" and \"classification\" problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price. Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our output about whether the house \"sells for more or less than the asking price.\" Here we are classifying the houses based on price into two discrete categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Regression - Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign. "

    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.\n",
